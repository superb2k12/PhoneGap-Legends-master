# PhoneGap Legends

*"PhoneGap Legends"* is a proof of concept app demonstrating a fantasy/RPG gaming scenario. This is not intended to be a fully/complete app or game engine, just a showcase of what PhoneGap apps are capable of.   The app demonstrates a game scenario that leverages best practices for HTML DOM elements to achieve an optimal user experience.  You can read full detail about the techniques used to develop this sample app at: http://www.tricedesigns.com/?p=2928

You can view a preview of this sample app live on devices at http://youtu.be/Pxzk6E6iWMA

There is a live, playable version of this demo for desktop or mobile browsers available at: http://tricedesigns.com/portfolio/phonegap_legends
However, **only webkit-based browsers are supported** at this time. I've only tested Chrome & Safari on the desktop, Chrome for Android, and Mobile Safari on iOS.
